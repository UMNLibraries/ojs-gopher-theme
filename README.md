# ojs-gopher-theme
Soon to be DEPRECATED. OJS 3 Theme Sponsored by University of Minnesota Libraries Publishing

The gopher theme will no longer be updated along with OJS. We have decided to switch back to the default theme for our journals. The default theme has a large userbase and lots of support from PKP. It also has accessibility features that match those we developed in gopher. We recommend that you switch to a new theme to continue to receive updates and support.
